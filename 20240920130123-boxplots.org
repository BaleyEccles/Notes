* Boxplots
 - A nice way of visualising a five number summary
 - The whiskers on the boxplots stretch from the lower/upper quartiles out towards the min/max.
   - Points that are more than 1.5x IQR away from the quartiles are shows separately to indicate that they are outliers
   - These are the dotted lines
