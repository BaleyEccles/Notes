 - Create a program flow chart so when I get back from a two week break I know what I am doing

** What You Learn From These Tasks
This week provided a good introduction to the implementation of my project. Understanding what AutoLISP is capable of is crucial in developing my understanding of how I will implement my project.

The program flow chart provides a great overview of what I need to accomplish over the coming weeks. It shows me how things will be done and along with documentation it tells me why.

     - Read sensors to determine object type
     - Write to actuators at specific times to move the objects
   - Create a ladder logic program to complete the following

Most of the week was spent learning how PLC's work and how to use them effectivly. I learnt Logix5000, a piece of design software for Rockwell PCL's, I implemented a ladder program in it that completes a complex task. This is a PLC's are used in industry all the time, hence learning them is a critical experience in my eningeering journey.
