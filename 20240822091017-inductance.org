* Inductance
- \[L\] is the inductance, which a representation for an object to its ability to conduct flux. It only depends on the dimensions of the object.
- \[L=N \frac{\phi}{i}\]
** Cylindrical Coil
- \[L=\mu \frac{N^2A}{l}\]
** Toroidal Coil
- \[L=\mu \frac{N^2h}{2\pi}\ln(\frac{b}{a})\]
  - where \[\mu\] is the permeability of the material, \[N\] is the number of turns, \[h\] is the height of the coil, and \[a\] and \[b\] are the inner and outer radius respectively.
** EMF Relation
- It can be related to emf using, which is [[id:0b3f01d9-4742-47d0-b78d-a2399a25c3c2][Faraday's law]].
  - \[\mathcal{E}=-N \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}=-L \frac{\partial i}{\partial t}\]
** Energy Relation
- The magnetic energy stored by an inductor is
  - \[W=\frac{1}{2}Li^2\]
