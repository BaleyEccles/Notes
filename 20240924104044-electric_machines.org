* Electric Machines
 - A [[id:a889f56d-55aa-4d63-b86a-50226324c218][Magnetic Circuit]] that converts voltage and current to/from torque and rotational velocity
   - Power $P$
   - Torque $\tau$
   - Rotational velocity $\omega$
   - \[P=\tau\omega\]
** Motor
 - Converts electrical energy into mechanical energy
   - \[v,i \rightarrow \tau,\omega\]
** Generator
 - Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy
   - \[\tau,\omega \rightarrow v,i\]
** Types
 - [[id:fad348bf-cf5d-4a48-9336-fcb9e28ed879][DC Machines]]
*** AC Machines
 - Synchronous Machines
 - Asynchronous Machines

** Torque Speed Curves (T-S Curves)

 - Governs if the motor is able to run the connected load.
   - If the required torque is less than the motors torque, then it will run
   - If the required torque is more than the motors torque, then it will not run
   - The speed will slow down until the motor and loads T-S curves are crossing

** Construction
 - Stator
   - Dose not typically move
 - Rotor
   - Free to move
   - Inside the machine
 - Field Winding
   - Produces the main flux component
 - Armature Winding
   - Where the most voltage is induced
   - Where the majority of power transfer occurs
