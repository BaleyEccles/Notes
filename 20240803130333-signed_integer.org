* Signed Integer
Each bit in a signed integer represents a power of two to be summed. The least significant bit being \[2^{0}\], the second most significant bit being \[2^{N-1}\] and the most significant bit being \[-2^{N}\], where \[N\] is the number of bits in the integer. This allows a range of numbers from \[-2^{N-1}\] to \[2^{N-1}-1\]. This format is known as twos complement.
