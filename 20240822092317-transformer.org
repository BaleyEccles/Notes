* Transformers
** Ideal Transformer
- An ideal transformer converts all of the enegy from one coil to the other. ie no energy loss.
- Electrical power ratio is one, \[\frac{p_1}{p_2}=1\]
  - \[\frac{\mathcal{E}_{1}}{\mathcal{E}_2}=\frac{N_1}{N_2}\]
  - \[\frac{i_1}{i_2}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}\]

** Losses To Hysteresis
- Some energy is lossed to hysteresis
  - \[P=K_h\cdot f \cdot B^{1.6}_{max}\]
    - \[K_h\] is a constant depending on the mateiral
    - \[f\] is the frequency
    - \[\B_{max}\] is the max [[id:cf104375-09b0-4334-84ce-3e0e1f41c234][Magnetic Flux Density]] established in the core
** Losses To Eddy Currents
- When the [[id:3ab115b0-6e42-46ec-b987-bd09c10d0ec6][Magnetic Flux]] ocillates eddy currents are created in the secondary and the core.
  - \[P_e=K_e\cdot f^2 \cdot B^{2}_{max}\]
    - \[K_e\] is a constant depending on the mateiral
    - \[f\] is the frequency
    - \[\B_{max}\] is the max [[id:cf104375-09b0-4334-84ce-3e0e1f41c234][Magnetic Flux Density]] established in the core
