* Bracketing Methods
A root finding method that only works in one dimension, but will always find the root if the interval is chosen correctly.
We choose two points, one that is above the x-axis and one that is below the x-axis, using the Intermediate Value Theroem, we know that there will be a root inbetween these points, so we itterativly make the intervall smaller. Unitl we converge on the root.
