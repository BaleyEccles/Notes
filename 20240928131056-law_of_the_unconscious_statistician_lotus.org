* Law Of The Unconscious Statistician (LOTUS)
 - To calculate the expected value of any function, h, of a random variable, X, we just need to take a weighted average of h
   - \[E[h(X)]=\sum_xh(x)P(X=x)\]
 - Two useful results for linear functions of a random variable are
   - \[E(aX+b)=aE(x)+b\]
   - \[Var(aX+b)=a^2Var(X)\]
