* Project Report 1

** Components
 - User Input Circuit
   - Buttons
   - Capacitors and resistors
 - Arduino Interface
   - Connects everything together.
 - Power Management
   - voltage regulator
     - L7805
   - PMOS transistor and Zener diode
     - For voltage control.
 - Water Level and Environmental Sensors
   - Pressure sensor
     - instrumentation amplifiers
     - Decide between a INA350AB or a INA350CD
       - Two gain options each
       - INA350ABS: 10 or 20
       - INA350CDS: 30 or 50

   - Temperature Sensor
     - $47k\Omega$ NTC thermistor
 - Motor Control
   - MCP601 Op-Amp
     - input and feedback resistors to set the gain.
   - Motor Driver
     - choose resistors and capacitors
     - Current Sensing Resistor:
       - Default value of $0.1\Omega$
 - Pinch Valve Control
   - servo motor
 - I2C LCD Interface
 - Mounting and Test Points

Table 6.1: Pin Functions
Gain select – logic low (G = 10 for INA350ABS and G = 30 for INA350CDS)
Gain select – logic high (G = 20 for INA350ABS and G = 50 for INA350CDS)
Gain select – no connect (G = 20 for INA350ABS and G = 50 for INA350CDS)

7.5 Electrical Characteristics (continued)
| Logic low threshold voltage (Gain Select)  | G = 10 for INA350ABS, G = 30 for INA350CDS |
| Logic high threshold voltage (Gain Select) | G = 20 for INA350ABS, G = 50 for INA350CDS |

8.1 Overview
INA350ABS has two gain options of 10 and 20. INA350CDS has two other gain options of 30 and 50
