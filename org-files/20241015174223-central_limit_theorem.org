* Central Limit Theorem
 - Let $x_1,x_2,...$ be a sequence of of IID variables with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
 - let $\overline{x}=\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}$
 - Then for large enough $n$, $\overline{x}$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
 - This does not depend on the shape of the underlying distribution
