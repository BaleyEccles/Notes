* Boost Converter
A DC-DC step up converter

   - This can be seen as a swapped [[id:dd9eeafa-3d34-473c-aafb-43261823e25f][Buck Converter]]

** Steady State Analysis
 - We store energy in the inductor ($L$) when the switch in on and the capacitor ($C_0$) maintains the output voltage
 - When the switch is off the diode conducts charging the capacitor ($C_0$) from the stored energy from the inductor ($L$).
 - By increasing the energy stored in the inductor we increase the output power
   - This is controlled by the duty cycle of the switch

*** Current Ripple
 - \[\Delta I_L = \frac{V_{in}}{L}T_{ON}\]
 - \[-\Delta I_L = \frac{V_{in} - V_o}{L}T_{DOWN}\]
*** Voltage Conversion Ratio in SS
\[\frac{V_O}{V_{in}} = \frac{T_{ON} + T_{DOWN}}{T_{DOWN}}= 1 + \frac{T_{ON}}{T_{DOWN}}\geq 1\]
** Continuous Conduction Mode
\[\frac{V_O}{V_{in}} = \frac{1}{D_{OFF}}\]
\[\frac{V_O}{V_{in}} = \frac{1}{1 - D_{ON}}\]
If we have a duty cycle of one ($D_{ON} = 1$) the formula says that we should have infinite voltage, however this is not true in reality. This is because:
 - There is not enough time to charge the capacitor
 - The switching loss becomes large
 - $D_{ON} = 0.8$ is the typical limit
   
** Discontinuous Conduction Mode
The load determines if we are in DCM:
\[R_{crit} = \frac{2V_0}{\Delta I_L(1 - D_{ON})} = \frac{2V_0^2}{\Delta I_L V_{in}}\]
 - If $R_L > R_{crit}$: DCM
 - If $R_L < R_{crit}$: CCM
[[file:Boost_Converter_DCM.png]]
\[\frac{V_0}{V_{in}} = \frac{T_{ON} + T_{DOWN}}{T_{DOWN}}\]
 - However, $T_{DOWN}$ is unknown

** Circuit specification and design of boost converter
\[C_0\Delta V_0 = \frac{V_0}{R}T_{ON}\]
