*** The Quarter Wave Transformer

We want $\Gamma = 0$, which occurs when $Z_{in} = Z_0$
\[Z_1 = \sqrt{Z_0Z_L}\]
 - This holds for one and multiple reflections.
 - The length of $Z_1$ is $\frac{\lambda}{4}$
**** Advantages
 - Simple to design
 - Easy to make
**** Disadvantages
 - Narrow bandwidth
 - Physical size constraint
 - May require complete PCB reconfiguration
   - As physical length of line is required to be added
 - Can only be used to match real load impedance

**** Example

*** Transformers of Arbitrary Length, with the Same Characteristic Impedance of the Feedline
We can either:
 - Add a piece of transmission line at the end
 - Or, add it somewhere in between
**** Example
[[xopp-pages:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/Quarter_Wave_Transformer_for_a_Complex_Load.xopp]]

*** Single Parallel Lumped Element Impedance Matching
Add a [[id:605fa252-6718-4527-bad5-7fc2f8d29bca][Capacitor]] or a [[id:bcc570ef-ee97-4bb9-9aca-1a81bd4a4ced][Inductance]] in parallel with the line
We need to find the distance $d$ and the value of $Y_s$
We can find the [[id:0850f22d-b384-4606-a3be-d262e8980559][Admittance]] $Y = G + jB$
 - \[G = \frac{R_L(1 + (\tan(\beta d))^2)}{R_L^2 + (X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))^2}\]
 - \[B = \frac{R_L^2\tan(\beta d) - (Z_0 - X_L\tan(\beta d))(X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))}{Z_0[R_L^2 + (X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))^2]}\]
We want to choose a length ($d$) such that $Y = G$, ie there is no imaginary component.

On a [[id:dc9bc12d-e2bb-407d-b221-efd07e1bd3a1][Smith Chart]] we can:
1. Constant SWR circle
2. Convert to [[id:0850f22d-b384-4606-a3be-d262e8980559][Admittance]]: $y_L = \frac{1}{z_L}$
3. Reactive element is placed at the point where the input resistance equals the characteristic impedance.
4. Point at which the SWR circle intersects the unit circle

*** Single Parallel Stub Impedance Matching
 - \[G = \frac{R_L(1 + (\tan(\beta d))^2)}{R_L^2 + (X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))^2}\]
 - \[B = \frac{R_L^2\tan(\beta d) - (Z_0 - X_L\tan(\beta d))(X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))}{Z_0[R_L^2 + (X_L + Z_0\tan(\beta d))^2]}\]

 - \[-jB = -\frac{j}{Z_0\tan(\beta l_{1_{SC}})}\]
 - \[\frac{l_{1_{SC}}}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{Y_0}{B}\right)= \frac{1}{\pi}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{Z_0B}\right)\]
Using a [[id:dc9bc12d-e2bb-407d-b221-efd07e1bd3a1][Smith Chart]]:
1. Constant SWR circle
2. Convert $z_L$ to $y_L$: $y_L = \frac{1}{z_L}$
3. Length is the difference between the input resistance matches the characteristic impedance resistance and the unit circle intercepts.
4. Rotate towards load to get length
   - OC: Left x-intercept 
   - SC: Right x-intercept 

**** Example
[[xopp-pages:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/Shunt_Stub_Impedance_Matching.xopp]]
*** Single Series Lumped Element
 - \[R = \frac{G_L(1 + (\tan(\beta d))^2)}{G_L^2 + (B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))^2}\]
 - \[X = \frac{G_L^2\tan(\beta d) - (Y_0 - B_L\tan(\beta d))(B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))}{Y_0[G_L^2 + (B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))^2]}\]
 - \[l_{SC} = -\frac{1}{2\pi}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X}{Z_0}\right)\]
 - \[l_{OC} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{Z_0}{X}\right)\]

Using  [[id:dc9bc12d-e2bb-407d-b221-efd07e1bd3a1][Smith Chart]]:
Same as in the Single Parallel Stub Impedance Matching / Single Parallel Lumped Element Impedance Matching cases, but we don't need to use the [[id:0850f22d-b384-4606-a3be-d262e8980559][Admittance]], $y_L$, we use the impedance.
 - SC: Left x-intercept 
 - OC: Right x-intercept
 - Rotate towards load to find the stub length $d_1$ or $d_2a$
*** Stub Impedance Matching
Similar to above
 - \[R = \frac{G_L(1 + (\tan(\beta d))^2)}{G_L^2 + (B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))^2}\]
 - \[X = \frac{G_L^2\tan(\beta d) - (Y_0 - B_L\tan(\beta d))(B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))}{Y_0[G_L^2 + (B_L + Y_0\tan(\beta d))^2]}\]
** When to each type
