* Non-Dispersive [[id:8c79d3ee-766a-4f72-a070-7a44d0f85ac1][Fading]] Channel
 - One thing that causes this is the [[id:02463fc8-1fc6-427f-acd1-03542a688e16][Doppler Effect]]
 - Increases bandwidth
   - \[B_{Doppler} = B_{static} + 2|f_{d,\max}|\]
** [[id:b46c0234-ae60-47ca-b311-c89820a62fd4][Coherence Time]]
The Coherence Time and Doppler Effect are inversely proportional
 - \[\Delta T \propto \frac{1}{f_{d}}\]
 At large Doppler Effects the Coherence Time is small and the channel is changing quickly.
 Rule of thumb:
  - \[\Delta T = \sqrt{\frac{9}{16\pi f_{d,\max}^2}}\]

Based on the coherence time we get two sub cases:
*** Fast-Fading
Each symbol gets a new attenuation:
\[y_i(t) = \lambda_iz_i(t) + n_s(t)\]

*** Slow Fading
Blocks of symbols get a attenuation
| Symbol                                 | Frame    | Attenuation |
| $1, 2,\hdots N$                              | 1        | $\lambda_1$          |
| $N+1, N+2,\hdots 2N$                   | 2        | $\lambda_2$          |
| $\vdots$                                      | $\vdots$        | $\vdots$             |
| $(M-1)N+1, (M-1)N+2,\hdots MN$  | M        | $\lambda_M$          |
*** Deep Fading
If $\lambda \approx 0$ the entire frame can be lost. There are methods to combat this.
