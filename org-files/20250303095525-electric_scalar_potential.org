* Electric Scalar Potential
The required work requried to move a unit charge from one point to another
 - \[V_{21}=V_2-V_1= -\int_{P_1}^{P_2}E\cdot dl\]
   - Where $V$ is the electric potential
   - And $P$ is a point
 - The work required to move a charge from one point and the back is equal to zero
   - \[\oint E\cdot dl=0\]
** Due to Point Charges
 - Due to a single charge $q$
   - \[V = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon|R-R_1|}\]
 - Due to many charges
   - \[V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{q_n}{|R-R_n|}\]
** Due to Continuous Distributions
 - for a volume distribution
   - \[V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\int_{v'}\frac{\rho_v}{R'}dv'\]
 - for a surface distribution
   - \[V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\int_{s'}\frac{\rho_s}{R'}ds'\]
 - for a line distribution
   - \[V = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\int_{l'}\frac{\rho_l}{R'}dl'\]

** Electric Field as a Function of Electric Potential
If we want to go the other way
 - \[E = -\del V\]
