* Nyquist-Shannon Capacity Theorem
 - $c = w\log_{2}\left( 1 + SNR\right)$
   - $c$: max bits/second
   - $wN_0$: Noise power
   - $P$: Signal power
 - $SNR$: [[id:13d613eb-9630-41af-ab3f-c15eabc686f5][Signal to noise ratio]]

This constrains how much data we can send through a channel. It gives us an upper limit on the bits/second.
