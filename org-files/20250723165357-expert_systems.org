* Expert Systems
 - [[file:Expert_System.png]]
   
 - An AI that uses if-then based rules
 - Rules and facts are kept separately
 - Is designed to mimic a human expert
** How They Work
 - Applies *Heuristics* to guide reasoning and reduce the search area for a solution
 - *Explanation capability* allows the system to review its own work and devise a better solution
 - Uses *symbolic reasoning*. Each piece of information, fact, rule or concept is a symbol.
   
** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC pascal
// Rule 1:
   IF Y is true
   AND D is true
   THEN Z is true
      
// Rule 2:
   IF X is true
   AND B is true
   AND E is true
   THEN Y is true
   
// Rule 3:
   IF A is true
   THEN X is true
#+END_SRC

Which is:

** Forward Chaining
 - Data-driven reasoning
 - The system can modify its data base
   - by executing the first rule and modifying the data base
 - [[file:Expert_System_Forward_Chaning.png]]

** Backward Chaining
 - Goal-driven reasoning
 - Searches the data base for a relevant rule, then executes it
 - [[file:Expert_System_Backward_Chaining.png]]

** Conflict Resolution


*** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC pascal
// Rule 1:
   IF the ‘traffic light’ is green
   THEN the action is go
      
// Rule 2:
   IF the ‘traffic light’ is red
   THEN the action is stop
      
// Rule 3:
   IF the ‘traffic light’ is red
   THEN the action is go
#+END_SRC

 - With forward chaining the action is go when the light is red

*** Highest Priority
Each of the rules are assigned a priority value and the one with the largest priority is ran

*** Most Specific Rule
Executes the rule that is the longest

*** Data Most Recently Entered
Executes the most recently added rule

** Uncertainty Management In Expert Systems

*** Bayesian reasoning
If each of the rules also have an assigned probability
#+BEGIN_SRC pascal
IF E is true
THEN H is true {with probability p}
#+END_SRC
\[\Pr(H|E) = \frac{\Pr(E|H)\times \Pr(H)}{\Pr(E|H)\times \Pr(H) + \Pr(E|\neg H)\times \Pr(\neg H)}\]

 - $\Pr(H)$ is the prior probability of hypothesis H being true
 - $\Pr(E|H)$ is the probability that hypothesis H being true will result in evidence E
 - $\Pr(\neg H)$ is the prior probability of hypothesis H being false
 - $\Pr(E|\neg H)$ is the probability of finding evidence E even when hypothesis H is false

With $n$ rules, it follows that:
\[\Pr(H_i | E_1E_2\hdots E_n) = \frac{\Pr(E_1 | H_i)\times \Pr(E_2 | H_i)\times \hdots \times \Pr(E_n | H_i)\times \Pr(H_i)}{\sum_{k=1}^m\Pr(E_1 | H_k) \times \Pr(E_2 | H_k)\times \hdots \times \Pr(E_n | H_k) \times \Pr(H_k)}\]

*** Certainty factors

| Almost certainly not |             −0.8 |
| Probably not         |             −0.6 |
| Maybe not            |             −0.4 |
| Unknown −0.2 to      |             +0.2 |
