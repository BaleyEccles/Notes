** Half-wave rectifier with resistive load
/Plot (using data saved from the oscilloscope) or insert screenshots or sketch by hand, waveforms for v s, v o, io and v D using the same time-scale x axis (so that they can be easily compared – including diode voltage), and discuss your observations briefly./

As expected this is a half wave rectifier. When the input voltage is positive the output voltage is positive, when the input voltage is negative the output voltage is zero. This is because the diode is blocking the negative voltages. This can also be applied to the current wave form.

/From your waveform measurements using oscilloscope, compare the dc output current and voltage against digital multimeter measurements and also against values determined by applying theoretical relationships for this rectifier. Present the different measurements and calculated values in table form, commenting on your observations./

The DC voltage can be calculated as seen in the following
\begin{align*}
V_{DC} &= \frac{V_m}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= \frac{V_{rms}\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= \frac{20\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= 9.0V
\end{align*}
The DC current then can simply be calculated using Ohms Law:
\[I_{DC} = \frac{V_{DC}}{R} = \frac{9}{48} = 0.188A\]

|                 | Measured | Theory |
| DC Voltage (V)  |      9.6 |    9.0 |
| DC Current (mA) |      157 |    188 |



** 2.2 Full-wave rectifier with resistive and inductive load
/Why was it necessary to measure the rectifier supply voltage waveform using the oscilloscope probes on the second of the two secondary windings or using two probes and the maths function? Describe what you think would happen if probes were still placed across the first winding (i.e. between points 1 and 2 on the circuit)./

To isolate the ground, the oscilloscope probes have common grounds. If the probes were still conected accros termrminals 1 and 2 and another probe was connected to the load, then the grounds shared between the probes would be located at different spots, creating a short between the input and the load. Hence connecting the probe accros terminals 3 and 4 allows us to create a new ground reference that is not effected by the rest of the circuit.

/For the resistive load only set up, plot (using data saved from the oscilloscope) or insert screenshots or sketch by hand, waveforms for $V_s$, $V o$, $i_o$ using the same time-scale x axis, and discuss your observations./

/Again for the resistive load only, from your waveform measurements using oscilloscope, compare the dc output current and voltage against digital multimeter measurements and also against values determined by applying theoretical relationships for this rectifier. Present the different measurements and calculated values in table form, commenting on your observations./
The DC voltage and current can be seen as in the following calculations:
\begin{align*}
V_{DC} &= \frac{2V_m}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= \frac{2V_{rms}\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= \frac{2 \cdot 20\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\pi} \\
V_{DC} &= 18.0V
\end{align*}
Then using Ohm's Law we can calculate the DC current
\[I_{DC} = \frac{V_{DC}}{R} = \frac{18}{48} = 0.375A\]

|                 | Measured | Theory |
| DC Voltage (V)  |     16.2 |   18.0 |
| DC Current (mA) |      338 |    375 |

/For the resistive and inductive load, plot (using data saved from the oscilloscope) or insert screenshots or sketch by hand, waveforms for v s, v o, i o and v D for the two diodes measured, using the same time-scale x axis (so that they can be easily compared – including diode voltage), and discuss your observations, including comparing against what was observed for resistive only load./
Input/Output Voltage:
[[file:20250828_133520.jpg]]
The voltage across the load is a DC voltage with ripple. This is because the inductor in the load stores energy (from current) and outputs current when the input current is negative. This results in the output voltage rising and reaching a steady state DC voltage with ripple.

The DC ripple for the inductive case is much less than the DC ripple in the purely resistive case. As mentioned this is because the inductor stores energy and releases it when necacary, creating a DC voltage.

Diode D3 and -D2 voltages:
[[file:20250828_131136.jpg]]

From the two diode voltages we can see how the rectifier works. When the source voltage is positive the voltage accross $D_3$ is zero and the voltage accross $D_2$ is the source voltage. And vice versa for negative voltages, this results in a full-wave rectified voltage at the output. If the voltage accross $D_1$ and $D_4$ were recorded we would expect that $D_1 = D_2$ and $D_3 = D_4$.

/Present your measured average (dc) and rms values of output voltage and current (for RL load). How do they compare to the values measured for the resistive load only and why?/
| $V_{DC}$ | $V_{rms}$ |   |
|          |           |   |
$$V_{dc(measured)}= 8.4V,\:I_{dc}= 332 mA$$

/By considering losses in the four diodes, estimate your overall rectifier circuit efficiency. Note: there are a few approaches you can take here, some which may require you to think about and perform some more measurements in the lab./


Diodes experience three types of losses, forward power loss $P_F$, reverse power loss $P_R$ and reverse recovery loss $P_{RR}$. The losses are equal for each diode, so we only need to calculate the loss for one cycle and then multiply the result by four.

First lets calculate the forward losses:
\begin{align*}
P_F &= V_F\cdot I_F \\
P_F &= V_F\cdot \frac{I_{DC}}{2} \\
P_F &= 0.95\cdot \frac{332\cdot 10^{-3}}{2} \\
P_F &= 0.1577\ W
\end{align*}

Next lets calculate the reverse losses:
\begin{align*}
P_R &= V_R\cdot I_R \\
P_R &= \frac{V_D}{2}\cdot \frac{I_{DC}}{2} \\
P_R &= \frac{13.9}{2}\cdot \frac{332\cdot 10^{-3}}{2} \\
P_R &= 1.1537\ W
\end{align*}

Lastly the reverse recovery loss, which would be calculated using $P_{RR} = \frac{1}{6}V_RI_{RM}t_{rr}f$, however we did not find $I_{RM}$. Although $P_{RR}$ would be minimal because $t_{rr} \approx 1\ \mu s}$ and $I_{RM}$ would be measured in micro amps. Hence $P_{RR}$ would have very little effect on the overall power loss of the rectifier.

Now we can calculate the efficency of the rectifier.
\begin{align*}
P_L &= 4\cdot P_F + 4\cdot P_R \\
P_L &= 4\cdot 0.16 + 4\cdot 1.15 \\
P_L &= 5.25\ W \\
&\\
P_T &= P_L + P_{load} \\
P_T &= 5.25 + \frac{11.4^2}{48} \\
P_T &= 8.0\ W \\
&\\
\eta &= 5.25/8.0 \\
\eta &= 65\%
\end{align*}
