/Detail the way you connected your oscilloscope probes and configured the oscilloscope to record simultaneously the source voltage, trigger signal, output voltage and current waveforms/
We made our commoon point where the + v_out is. Ch1 is the secondary transformer output. Ch2 is at the bottom of v_out. Ch3 is between 1\Omega and 47\Omega. Ch4 is + trigger input.

/Based on your observation, at what firing angle did you observe there to first be a boundary between continuous and discontinuous conduction (of current in the load). Compare to what you might expect from a theoretical view point?/
