** Part 3 – Model Estimation
*** 1. From the empirical data in configuration #3 (previous table), estimate a 2nd order Laplace domain model for the plant at one of the operating points.
Using measured step response metrics
:TODO: /Selected operating point initial and final value for $V_P(t)$:/
:TODO: /Estimated gain $K$, damping factor $\zeta$, and natural frequency $\omega_n$:/
:TODO: /Estimated prototype second order transfer function:/

Using MATLAB’s Control Systems Toolbox system identification app
:TODO: /Selected operating point initial and final value for $V_P(t)$:/
:TODO: /Estimated gain $K$, damping factor $\zeta$, and natural frequency $\omega_n$:/
:TODO: /Estimated prototype second order transfer function:/

:TODO: /Comment on the differences between the empirical models, how well this fit the data, and any differences between the empirical estimation and that developed from theory./
*** 2. Use you empirical models to calculate the expected step response metrics (gain, settling time, rise time) at one of your other operating points for the same step size as applied in your Part 2 testing (as in previous table).

:TODO: /Selected operating point initial and final value for $V_p(t)$:/
:TODO: /Predicted step response metrics (gain, rise time, settling time) for each model at the selected operating point:/
:TODO: /How well do your empirical models generalise to different operating points or initial conditions?/
