- Current
  - \[I_{C}\] The current from/into the collector
  - \[I_{B}\] The current from/into the base
  - \[I_{E}\] The current from/into the emitter
  - \[I_E=I_B+I_C\]
** DC Analysis
 - Capacitors are open circuits
 - Equations
   - \[I_C=\beta I_B\]
   - \[I_E=(\beta+1)I_B\]
   - \[V_{BE}=0.7V\]

** AC Analysis
Solve for the DC Q-point then use:

   - There will be resistors in parralel with $\beta r_e$ and $r_o$, based on the config. Which will be used to find $Z_i$ and $Z_o$.
   - $V_i$ is the voltage from e to b
   - $V_o$ is the voltage from e to c
   - Connect DC sources to ground
   - Capacitors are short circuit
 - Equations
   - \[r_e=\frac{26mV}{I_E}\]
   - \[A_{v}=\frac{-Z_o}{r_{e}}\]
** Frequency Response
To determent what frequencies will work with the BJT we need to look at the capacitors.
 - There are two calculations we need to do
 - We can use [[id:79b422d5-ff34-41ab-8b86-67e6ecfc68ad][Bode Plots]] to represent the frequency response
*** Low frequency
 - We are trying to find the lowest frequency that will work for the current BJT configuration
   - So, we need to take the largest of:
     - The base input capacitor
     - The collector output capacitor
     - The any other capacitor
       - Example: emitter bypass capacitor
   - Using the following equation
     - \[f_{1}=\frac{1}{2\pi R C\]
     - Where:
       - $R$ can be found by assuming the other capacitors are short circuits
         - And finding the equivalent resistance
       - $C$ is the current capacitor being analysed
*** High frequency
 - We are trying to find the highest frequency that will work for the current BJT configuration
   - $C_S$, $C_E$ and $C_C$ are not considered at high frequencies
   - So, we need to take the smallest of:
     - The collector bypass capacitor
     - The [[id:1c559316-5797-465c-b720-2e62215ac4d0][Miller capacitance]]
   - Using the following equation
     - \[f_{2}=\frac{1}{2\pi R C\]
     - Where:
       - $R$ can be found by assuming the other capacitors are short circuits
         - And finding the equivalent resistance
       - $C$ is the current capacitor being analysed
