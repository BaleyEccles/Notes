 - Diodes fail when the reverse-biased voltage is higher than the breakdown voltage
 - Current limiting is applied to reduce heat in the diode
 - Shockley's Equation
   - \[i_d = i_s\left[e^{\frac{qv_d}{kT_cA_n}} - 1\right]\]
 - Power losses mainly come from the forward voltage drop

** [[id:47517c75-582b-4948-a2a7-f88e883e7b65][Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)]]
 - We want low $v_{CE}$, as this will reduce the amount of losses

** [[id:f001a12d-1b96-40c9-b46f-636528af9451][Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET)]]
 - When $V_{GS} > V_{TH} \approx 8$ the drain current $i_{ds}$ has the lowest resistance
 - Conduction Losses:
   - \[i_{ds}^2R_{ds(on)}\]
   - The current is rms
   - Lower is better
 - Switching Losses:
   - When MOSFETs switch on and off there are power losses

** [[id:9be2c312-bd6d-40a0-9d41-9e2ccde93a1f][Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)]]
 - Conduction losses:
   - \[V_{CE}\times I_{CE}\]
   - When on

 - Useful in high voltage applications
