* Delta Function
Also known as the unit impulse.
Denoted \[\delta (x)\].
Height of \[1\] at \[x=0\] and height of \[0\] every where else.
Has an area of \[1\] ie \[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (x)dx=1\]. This is also true for ranges that arent \[\pm\infty\], as long as it contains \[0\].
Relation to [[id:df314ae5-1b35-49a3-be34-8d0aeb720ff3][Unit Step]]:
\[u(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}\delta (\lambda)d\lambda \Leftrightarrow \delta (t)=\frac{du(t)}{dt}\]
** Sampling Property
\[f(t)\delta (t-t_{1})=f(t_1)\delta (t-t_{1})\].
That is we can use the delta function to take impulse at a point \[t_{1}\].
** Sifting Property
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\delta (t-t_1)dt=f(t_1)\].
That is we can use the integral and delta function to evaluate a function at a point \[t_1\].
This is also known as inpulse decompasistion
