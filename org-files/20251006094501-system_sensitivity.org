* System Sensitivity
Typically when we make a system faster we also make it easier to make unstable.
Robustness is when we want to meet some requirement and allow for variation without making the system stable
Sensitivity is defined as:
\[S_{F: P} = \lim_{\Delta P\rightarrow 0}\frac{\textrm{Fractional change in } F}{\textrm{Fractional change in } P} = \frac{P}{F}\frac{\partial F}{\partial P}\]

** For A Second Order System
Sensitivity of $a$
\[T(s) = \frac{K}{s^2 + as + K\]
\[P_{T:a} = \frac{a}{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial a} = \frac{-as}{s^2 + as + K}\]

:TODO: Add Image when slides are released

** Gang Of Six
A set of transfer functions can be derived. These determeine how the system will behave.
:TODO: Add the gang of six
Plotting these will give insight into how the system behaves
*** Gang Of Four
The Gang Of Six can be simplified to the Gang Of Four if the feedforward term is set to 1 ($F = 1$):
