* Optimal Receivers
 - A receiver that makes the best estimate of $s_m(t)$ given a measurement of $r(t)$
   - This minimises the probability of an error.
The best choose for $m$
\[\hat{m} = \underset{1\leq m \leq M}{\max} \frac{\Pr(m)\Pr(\underline{r} | s_m)}{\Pr(\underline{r})}\]
 - $\Pr(m)$ is known as the prior probabilities.
 - $\Pr(\underline{r})$ is the probability of seeing any given received signal

** Maximum Aposteriori Probability (MAP) Detector
\[\hat{m} = \underset{1\leq m \leq M}{\max} \Pr(m)\Pr(\underline{r} | s_m)\]
When the probability of each symbol ($m$) is not equally likely.
The decision boundary aren't easy to see.

** Maximum Likelihood (ML) Detector
When dealing with a [[id:788c38cf-cc37-463b-84d6-a40be1715904][Non-Dispersive Channel]], and good source compression.
\[\hat{m} = \underset{1\leq m \leq M}{\max} \Pr(\underline{r} | s_m)\]
 - ML = MAP if $\Pr(m)$are equiprobable
 - ML is suboptimal otherwise
ML is easier to implement
     
** Examples
[[id:e5b0d8e1-bef3-4b52-af41-355047228d01][The Matched Filter]] is an example of a optimal receiver, if $n(t)$ is [[id:f043ac02-9b06-42f2-b9cd-ad32801de2ed][The AWGN Channel]] and each $s_m(t)$ is equally-likely to be sent
