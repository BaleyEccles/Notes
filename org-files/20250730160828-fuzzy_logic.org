* Fuzzy Logic
 - Based on the idea that everything can be represented as a value from a range
   - We assign an number from 0 to 1 which represents how well a given data point fits the set

 - Membership function
   - \[\mu_A(x)\]
   - A function that defines where the data point sits in the set of possible values
 - Degree of membership
   - The value which the data takes in the membership function
 - Hedge
   - A subset of a fuzzy set
   - Some possible shapes that can define the subset
     - A little, slightly, Very, Extremely
     - Very very, more or less, somewhat, indeed
     - Each of which has their mathematical representation as a modification on the membership function

** Operations
 - Compliment
   - NOT
   - \[1 - x\]
 - Intersection
   - AND
   - \[\min(x, y)\]
 - Union
   - OR
   - \[\max(x,y)\]

** Fuzzy Rules
#+begin_src pascal
IF x is A
AND y is B
THEN z is C

IF x is A
OR y is B
THEN z is C
#+end_src

#+begin_src matlab :results output
clc;
clear;
close all;
t = 0:0.01:10;
y = sin(t);
#+end_src

** Mamdani Fuzzy Interface
1. Fuzzification
2. Rule evaluation
3. Aggergation of rule
4. Defuzzification

** Sugeno Fuzzy Interface
We apply rules in the following form:
#+begin_src pascal
IF x is A
AND y is B
THEN z is k
#+end_src
