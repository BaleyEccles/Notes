* Introduction
:TYLER:
 - What is a UPS?
 - Types of UPS

* Topologies
:BALEY:

** Transformer-Based
[[./Transformer_Based_UPS.jpg]]
NOTES:
{
Consists of rectifier, inverter, line frequency transformer and bypass circuit

Converts AC to DC to charge the battery, then DC to AC for the load

Uses two power frequency transformers, one to step down the voltage coming in to charge the battery, and another to step up the battery voltage to the AC mains voltage.

A bypass switch is present, if rectifier, battery or inverter is damaged then the bypass switch will activate, allowing power to flow pass the UPS.

*** Advantages
 - Galvanic isolation
 - Support high power

*** Disadvantages
 - They require large transformers for line frequency conversion
   - Increased cost
 - Low efficiency
   - High current flows through the switches

** Transformer-Less
[[./Four_Legged_Transformer_Less.jpg]]

*** Advantages
 - Less costly
 - Highly efficient
 - Smaller than transformer based UPS
   
*** Disadvantages
 - More likely to be effected by the transients
   - Miscellaneous devices connected to the main utility grid
 - Battery cost is higher
   - Needs to achieve high DC link voltage
 - Lower reliability

** High Frequency Transformer Based
[[./High_Frequency_Transformer_UPS.jpg]]
Uses fast switching diodes and switches

*** Advantages
 - Smaller transformers
 - Galvanic isolation
 - Better efficiency

*** Disadvantages
 - More switches
   - Reduces efficiency
   - Higher cost

Application:
1. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the output voltage
2. Transient response
3. Power factor correction
4. Voltage/current regulation

Types
1. Single loop control
   - Output voltage is used for feedback
2. Multi-loop system
   - Multiple parameters are used for feedback
3. Predictive control
   - Predicts the future behaviour of the system
4. Repetitive control
   - Rejects periodic disturbances
5. Iterative learning
   - Adjusted through iteration
   - Achieves zero tracking error
6. Slide mode control
   - Effective against non-linear systems
