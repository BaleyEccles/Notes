* Block Diagrams
** Sum
- represented as a plus sign in a circle
- adds the inputs
** Unit Delay
- Represented as a square with a T inside
- Delays the input by one
** Multiplyer
- Represented by a triangle with a number inside
- Multiplies the input by the number
** Solving
The act of finding the [[id:124ac03e-eb71-4731-a90c-55171f9edb80][Difference Equation]] for the block diagram
*** Output goes into the block diagram
If the output goes back into the diagram we can work backwards from the output until we get a [[id:124ac03e-eb71-4731-a90c-55171f9edb80][Difference Equation]]
*** Output does not go into the block diagram
If the output does not go back into the diagram we must define the input to a unit delay as \[q[n]\] and work through the system to get two or more equations. Where they can be delayed, and rearagnged to get one equation.
