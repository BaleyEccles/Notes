* Carrier-to-Noise Ratio
When considering large scale effects of [[id:cfec5fb5-467e-4a16-a78c-32ebbdd4fb9a][Channel Noise]].
_NOTE_: $c$ becomes the power
The noise ($\frac{c}{N_0}$) is no longer unit less, it is measured in Hz.
\[\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{c}{N_0}T_b = \frac{c}{N_0}\frac{1}{R_b}\]
 - $R_b$ is the data rate
