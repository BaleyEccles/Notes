* Artificial Neural Networks
Uses 'neurons', which are similar to ones in the brain.
 - They are connected by weighting links, which can pass signals to a another neuron

** Supervised Learning
When we know what the output should be. For example images of animals, we know which animal is what, the AI is expected to give us are already known value.

** Activation Functions
A function that relates the inputs and weights to the output.
Different activation functions can change how fast the network arrives at an answer
*** Step Function
\[ Y^{\textrm{step}} = \begin{cases}
1, & \textrm{if } X\geq 0\\
0, & \textrm{if } X < 0\\
\end{cases}\]

*** Sign Function
\[ Y^{\textrm{sign}} = \begin{cases}
+1, & \textrm{if } X\geq 0\\
-1, & \textrm{if } X < 0\\
\end{cases}\]

*** Sigmoid Function
\[ Y^{\textrm{sigmoid}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-X}}\]

*** Linear Function
\[ Y^{\textrm{linear}} = X\]
