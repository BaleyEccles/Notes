* Artificial Neural Networks
Uses 'neurons', which are similar to ones in the brain.
 - They are connected by weighting links, which can pass signals to a another neuron

** Supervised Learning
When we know what the output should be. For example images of animals, we know which animal is what, the AI is expected to give us are already known value.

** Unsupervised Learning
