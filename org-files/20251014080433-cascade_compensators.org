* Cascade Compensators
 - [[id:81008646-ec90-4990-a45a-8723b13c16cb][Integration Windup]]
 - [[id:14afe3da-5e70-40c3-9f6a-5c8b6b5424bc][Set-Point Weighting]]
** Overview
*** PI
Function:
 - Improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]]
Compensator
 - PI
Transfer Function
 - \[K\frac{s + z_c}{s}\]
Characteristics
1. Increase system type
2. Error becomes zero
3. Zero at $-z_c$ is small and negative
4. Active circuits are required to implement
   
*** Lag
Function:
 - Improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]]
Compensator
 - Lag
Transfer Function
 - \[K\frac{s + z_c}{s + p_c}\]
Characteristics
1. Error is improved, but not zero
2. pole at $-p_c$ is small and negative
3. Zero at $-z_c$ is close to, and to the left of the pole at $-p_c$
4. Active circuits are not required to implement
   
*** PD
Function:
 - Improve transient response
Compensator
 - PD
Transfer Function
 - \[K(s + z_c)\]
Characteristics
1. Zero at $-z_c$ is selected to put design point on root locus
2. Active circuits are required to implement
3. Can cause noise and saturation; implement with rate feedback or with a pole (lead)

*** Lead
Function:
 - Improve transient response
Compensator
 - Lead
Transfer Function
 - \[K\frac{s + z_c}{s + p_c}\]
Characteristics
1. Zero at $-z_c$ and pole at $-p_c$ are selected to put design point on root locus
2. Pole at $-p_c$ is more negative than zero at $-z_c$
3. Active circuits are not required to implement

*** PID
Function:
 - Improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]] and transient response
Compensator
 - PID
Transfer Function
 - \[K\frac{(s + z_{lag})(s + z_{lead})}{s}\]
Characteristics
1. Lag zero at $-z_{lag}$ and pole at origin improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]]
2. Lead zero at $-z_{lead}$ improves transient response
3. Lag zero at $-z_{lag}$ is close to, and to the left of the origin
4. Lead zero at $-z_{lead}$ is selected to put design point on root locus
5. Active circuits are required to implement
6. Can cause noise and saturation; implement with rate feedback or with an additional pole
   
Standard Form   
 - \[u(t) = K_p\left(e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i}\int e(\tau)d\tau + T_d\frac{de(t)}{dt}\right)\]
Parallel Form
 - \[u(t) = K_pe(t) + K_i\int e(\tau)d\tau + K_d\frac{de(t)}{dt}\]

*** Lag-Lead
Function:
 - Improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]] and transient response
Compensator
 - Lag-Lead
Transfer Function
 - \[K\frac{(s + z_{lag})(s + z_{lead})}{(s + p_{lag})(s + p_{lead})}\]
Characteristics
1. Lag pole at $-p_{lag}$ and lag zero at $-z_{lag}$ are used to improve [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]]
2. Lead pole at $-p_{lead}$ and lead zero at $-z_{lead}$ improves transient response
3. Lag pole at $-p_{lag}$ is small and negative
4. Lag zero at $-z_{lag}$ is close to, and to the left of, the lag pole at $-p_{lag}$
5. Lead zero at $-z_{lead}$ and lead pole at $-p_{lead}$ are selected to put design point on root locus
6. Lead pole at $-p_{lead}$ is more negative than lead zero at $-z_{lead}$
7. Active circuits are not required to implement
