* Gray Coding
A method to ensure that only one bit is different that their neighbours.
There is no reason to not use Gray Coding, that is, it should always be used.

** Generate Gray Codes
1. Start with the Gray code of n-1 bits
2. Generate the second list by reflecting the first list
3. Prefix every entry in the old list with a '0'
4. Prefix every entry in the new list with a '1'
5. Concatenate the two lists
