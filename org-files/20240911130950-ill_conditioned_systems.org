* Ill-Conditioned Systems
Given \[AX=B\]
and \[X=A^{-1}B\]
If there is a large change in B for a small change in X, the system is said to be [[id:ebf41481-b929-4dcd-9ccf-0917326e416b][Ill-Conditioned]].
This is bad.
** Condition Number
A mesure of how well/poorly conditioned A is.
\[K=\lvert\lvert A\rvert\rvert\lvert\lvert A^{-1}\rvert\rvert\]
 - \[K<100\] is good
 - \[K>500\] is bad
