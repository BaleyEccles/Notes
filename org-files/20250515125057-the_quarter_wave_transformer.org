* The Quarter Wave Transformer

[[file:Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 08-50-39 ENG305 Week 10 Lecture Notes.pdf.png]]
We want $\Gamma = 0$, which occurs when $Z_{in} = Z_0$
\[Z_1 = \sqrt{Z_0Z_L}\]
 - This holds for one and multiple reflections.
 - The length of $Z_1$ is $\frac{\lambda}{4}$
** Advantages
 - Simple to design
 - Easy to make
** Disadvantages
 - Narrow bandwidth
 - Physical size constraint
 - May require complete PCB reconfiguration
   - As physical length of line is required to be added
 - Can only be used to match real load impedance

** Example
