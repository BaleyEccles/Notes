* Nyquist Criterion
/Given a Nyquist contour ${\displaystyle \Gamma _{s}}$, let ${\displaystyle P}$ be the number of poles of ${\displaystyle G(s)}$ encircled by ${\displaystyle \Gamma _{s}}$, and ${\displaystyle Z}$ be the number of zeros of ${\displaystyle 1+G(s)}$ encircled by ${\displaystyle \Gamma _{s}}$. Alternatively, and more importantly, if ${\displaystyle Z}$ is the number of poles of the closed loop system in the right half plane, and ${\displaystyle P}$ is the number of poles of the open-loop transfer function ${\displaystyle G(s)}$ in the right half plane, the resultant contour in the ${\displaystyle G(s)}$-plane, ${\displaystyle \Gamma _{G(s)}}$ shall encircle (clockwise) the point ${\displaystyle (-1+j0)}$ ${\displaystyle N}$ times such that ${\displaystyle N=Z-P}$./
** For A Feedback System
For a feedback system
\[T(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)} = \frac{N_GD_H}{D_GD_H + N_GN_H}\]

** Mapping
For some complex point $Q$. If we apply some function $F(s)$ we get a mapping from one point ($Q\prime$) to another.
Choose a set of points such that the set creates a loop on the $j\omega + \sigma$ plot. The mapping will also create a loop.
 - Pole in the loop will subtract a $360^o$ phase shift
 - Zeroes in the loop will add a $360^o$ phase shift   
 - Poles and zeroes not in the loop we will genrate a small phse shift
The output mapping will go around $N_{\textrm{clockwise}} = Z_{\textrm{in}} - P_{\textrm{in}}$ times in the clockwise
The output mapping will go around $N_{\textrm{c-clockwise}} = P_{\textrm{in}} - Z_{\textrm{in}}$ times in the counter clockwise

*** Usage
If we know the mapping we can use it to find the location of the zeroes

** Gain Margin
How much the gain in the system can be increase or decrease until it becomes unstable

** Phase Margin
How much the phase before the system becomes unstable
 - We can change the phase by introducing a time delay
   - \[G(s) = e^{-sT}G(s)\]
   -  \[G(j\omega) = e^{-j\omega T}G(j\omega) = |G(j\omega)|\angle \{\omega T - G(j\omega)\}\]
