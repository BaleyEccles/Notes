* Bandpass Signals
 - In the frequency domain the signal has two parts equal distant ($f_{0}$) from the origin
   - $f_{0}$ is the center of the signal
** Look Like
 - [[xopp-figure:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/Banpass Magnitude.xopp]]
** Energy
 - \[E_{x} = \frac{E_{x_{l}}}{2}\]
 - The bandpass equivalent signal has half as much energy than the [[id:f677e2ac-10a8-4754-82f9-57f93fb56789][Lowpass Signal]]
