* Higher Order Systems
[[id:80120a64-eeb7-471c-94e2-a3c537a21699][Laplace]] Domain:
 - \[C(s) = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B(s + \zeta \omega_n) + C\omega_d}{(s + \zeta\omega_n)^2 + \omega_d} + \frac{D}{s + \alpha_r}\]
Time Domain:
 - \[c(t) = Au(t) + e^{-\zeta\omega_n t}\left(B\cos(\omega_dt) + C\sin(\omega_d t)\right) + De^{-\alpha_rt}\]

 - The closer the poles are to the origin the more dominant they are
   - The closes poles are called the dominant poles
   - This is because they have more of an effect on the overall system


** Third Order Systems
 - The real pole should be at least 5 time further away from the other two poles
   - This is when it will be considered significant
