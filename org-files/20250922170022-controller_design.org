* Controller Design
** Nomenclature
Process Variable - The variable that is trying to be controlled (output of the system)
Control Variable - The variable that is being actuated (output of the controller)
Set Point - The input or reference value or slow changing variable

** Classical Controller Approaches
 - Bang-Bang Control
 - Rule Based Control
   - [[id:117d1797-6d46-47e2-81d2-1360da07666b][Fuzzy Logic]]
     - Can be used along with a PID to create a more complicated system
 - Time-Domain PID implementations

** PID
Standard Form   
 - \[u(t) = K_p\left(e(t) + \frac{1}{T_i}\int e(\tau)d\tau + T_d\frac{de(t)}{dt}\right)\]
Parallel Form
 - \[u(t) = K_pe(t) + K_i\int e(\tau)d\tau + K_d\frac{de(t)}{dt}\]

*** Tuning Approaches
Zieglerâ€“Nichols Tuning Method
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method
Astrom-Hagglund Tuning Method

** Design Via [[id:bcab7053-f2ea-4117-a8c8-eeea97587087][Root Locus]]
1. Use the angle to find the point at which it is $180^o$
2. Use the magnitude to find the gain

** Improving [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]] Using Cascade Compensations

*** PI Controller
This is done by adding an integrator and a zero close to the origin
 - In series with $G(s)$ we have $\frac{K(s + a)}{s}$

**** Passive Implementation
It is not possible to build and ideal integrator with passive components
 - Now we have $G_c(s) = \frac{s + z_c}{s + p_c}$
