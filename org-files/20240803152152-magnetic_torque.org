* Magnetic Torque
Magnetic torque is used when we are dealing with motors.
The equation that governs the torque and magnetic field relationship is:
\[\vec{\tau}=\vec{m}\times\vec{B}\Rightarrow\tau=iAB\sin(\theta)\]
\[vec{m}\] is the magnetic dipole given by \[\vec{m}=iA\hat{n}\]
\[\tau\] is the torque, measured in Newton meters (Nm)
\[i\] is the conventional current, measured in Amperes (A)
\[A\] is the area of the frame, measured in meters squared (m^2)
\[B\] is the magnetic flux density, measured in Tesla (T)
\[\theta\] is given by \[\theta=\omega t\], where omega is the rotational frequency and t is time
