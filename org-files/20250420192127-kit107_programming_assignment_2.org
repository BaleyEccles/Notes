** a
Sorted list.
We can sort the eggs based on their data, such as the weight or the size. This will allow us to easily access the data.
** b
Array.
Given that we have all the eggs stored in a text there will be no need to add more. This will be more faster than using a linked-list, as we wont need to jump around in memory as much.
** c
List.
We know that there will only be seven chocolatiers. This will provide simple sequential iteration over the data set.
** d
Array.
There are only seven chocolatiers, there is no need to add more. So the limitation of the array, of not being able to add more, will not effect us.
