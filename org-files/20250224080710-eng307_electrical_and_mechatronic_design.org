* Notes
** Metrics
 - Must have units
 - Very specific
   - Can be ranges
 - Satisfy users specifications
** DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis)
 - Used to verify the specifications are correct
*** Design
 - Used when designing a product or service
*** Failure Mode
 - Specific way in which the system/component may fail to meet the specifications
*** Effect Analysis
 - Consequences of the failure
** Week 6
