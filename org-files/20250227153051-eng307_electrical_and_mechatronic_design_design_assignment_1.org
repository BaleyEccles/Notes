* ENG307 - Electrical and Mechatronic Design - Design Assignment 1
** Exercise 1 - Specifications
*** LED
 - An LED that is visible in day and night lighting conditions
   - It must brighten during the day and dim during the night
 - [[https://coloer.com/blogs/news/guide-to-outdoor-lighting-brightness]]

*** Speakers
 - Speaker(s) must be loud enough to overcome the ambiant outside noise.
 - [[https://soundproof.expert/decibel-chart-noise-level/]]
 - Metric
   - Greater than 50dB
     - Must be able to hear during the rain
*** Microphone
 - The voice must be clear
   - Senistive to 20Hz - 20KHz
     - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Measurements_and_specifications]]

*** Dimensions
 - The door bell must not be too heavy/large
   - So it can be wall mounted

   - 4.98 in. x 2.43 in. x 0.87 in
*** Wi-Fi
 - Wi-Fi must be strong enough to reach on the other side of the house
   - It must be strong enough to go through multiple walls
*** Metrics
 - Force of button https://ergoweb.com/force-guidelines/
 - Mic sens https://www.knowles.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/mm25-33663-000.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn=c3ae71b1_0
 - Speaker Vol https://soundproof.expert/decibel-chart-noise-level/
 - Light brightness https://coloer.com/blogs/news/guide-to-outdoor-lighting-brightness
   - https://www.lightingcouncil.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lighting-Council-Australia-LED-Buyers-Guide.pdf
 - Wi-Fi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11
   - https://www.whippedcreamsounds.com/mp3-bitrate-differences/
** Exercise 2 - System Topology
*** AC -> DC
 - Mains powered (240V AC)
   - The door bell must reduce the power for the LED and other components
   - AC -> DC converter
     - 5V? 10V? 15V?
*** Microphone
**** Filter
 - The microphone must have a filter on it
   - It will be outside, so there will be background noise
*** Speaker
*** LED
**** Change Brigtmess
*** Wi-Fi Rx/Tx
** Exercise 3 - Test Cases
*** AC -> DC
 - 
*** Microphone
**** Filter
*** Speaker
*** LED
**** Change Brigtness
*** Wi-Fi Rx/Tx

** Exercise 1
_THIS WAS LONGISH_
It was decided that the door bell must have three main input methods, a button, a microphone and an application that would connect via Wi-Fi.
