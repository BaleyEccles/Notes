* Magnetic Force
A magnetic field acted upon a current will create a force.
This force can be calculated using:
\[\vec{F}=i\vec{l}\times \vec{B} \Rightarrow F=ilB\sin(\theta)\]
\[F\] is the force, measured in Newtons (N)
\[i\] is the conventional current, measured in Amperes (A)
\[l\] is the length, measured in meters (m)
\[B\] is the magnetic flux density, measured in Tesla (T)
\[\theta\] is the angle between \[i\] \[B\]
\[F\], \[i\] and \[B\] are at right angles. So the right hand rule can be used to find the direction, with the index finger as \[i\], the middle finger as \[B\] and the thumb as \[F\]. If the magnetic field is at an angle to the current, then only the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is translated into force.
