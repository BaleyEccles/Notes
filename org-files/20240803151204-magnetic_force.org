* Magnetic Force
A magnetic field acted upon a current will create a force.
This force can be calculated using:
 -  \[\vec{F}=i\vec{l}\times \vec{B} \Rightarrow F=ilB\sin(\theta)\]
   - $F$ is the force, measured in Newtons (N)
   - $i$ is the conventional current, measured in Amperes (A)
   - $l$ is the length, measured in meters (m)
   - $B$ is the magnetic flux density, measured in Tesla (T)
   - $\theta$ is the angle between \[i\] \[B\]
   - $F$, \[i\] and \[B\] are at right angles. So the right hand rule can be used to find the direction, with the index finger as \[i\], the middle finger as \[B\] and the thumb as \[F\]. If the magnetic field is at an angle to the current, then only the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is translated into force.

 - \[F_1 = -\hat{y} \frac{I_2l\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}\]
 - \[F_2 = \hat{y} \frac{I_1l\mu_0I_2}{2\pi d}\]
* Magnetic Torque
 - \[T = m\times  B\]
