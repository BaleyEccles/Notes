* Modeling [[id:e8b3e3c8-1012-4b36-8aa5-81ebf472052f][Systems]]
 - Any [[id:129878a7-2136-473b-ac33-74da80b12e67][Linear and Time Invarient Systems (LTI)]] can be modelled as a differential equation
   - But this is nasty
   - We can use [[id:d2083e8a-7a7a-48a8-89f4-9d13bba76b50][transform theory]] or [[id:5a63667f-a24c-4a46-99de-0997d54296b7][convolution]] to convert it into an easier form
   - This can also be done using [[id:e1293290-fe17-4467-8083-142aa848421e][State Space Representation]]
 - [[id:5233f426-b528-4635-9487-e7047b781af2][Steady State Error]]

** Systems
 - [[id:698f46a5-c12f-462a-bc34-bcc6fc1d9cb3][First Order Systems]]
 - [[id:405c4318-12e5-45f8-8f69-c074d41a1481][Second Order Systems]]
 - [[id:b7db8941-7b2a-410a-a78e-ec8ae7b193c5][Higher Order Systems]]
 - [[id:58f545f0-abf6-483d-8b44-046bad7f38a6][Feedback Systems]]

** Effects of [[id:720b73a5-8e1c-465f-a0a2-3db6189efbf4][Zeros]]
\[T(s) = \frac{(s + a)}{(s + b)(s + c)}\]
 - If the zero is very far away, it can be taken as a amplification
   - \[T(s) \approx \frac{a}{(s + b)(s + c)}\]

 - If the zeroes are close to the origin we can have non-minimum-phase responses
   
** Feedback Systems
For negative feedback
\[R(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}\]
 - $G(s)$ is the plant
 - $H(s)$ is the feedback

** Linearization
 - We can convert non-linear systems to linear ones
 - This can be done using a [[id:356b1296-2188-4d04-9ccc-a4381bcc02b6][Taylor Series]]

** Systems with a Time-Delay
 - FOPD - First Order Plus Delay
 - FODT - First Order with Dead Time
 - [[xopp-figure:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/Time_Delay_System.xopp]]
   - $T_d$ is the dead time or time delay
Using the time-shifting property of the [[id:80120a64-eeb7-471c-94e2-a3c537a21699][Laplace Transform]]
 - \[G_1(s) = \frac{a}{s + a}\]
 - \[G_2(s) = \frac{a}{s + a}e^{-sT_d}\]
** Examples
[[xopp-pages:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/ENG331-System-Example-1.xopp]]

** Feedback Form
A Block Diagram of the Feedback Form
 - [[./Feedback_Form.png]]
Works by calculating an error signal and feeding it back into the controller
\[G_e(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 \pm G(s)H(s)}\]

** Stability
[[id:847ec0e7-da66-447a-9835-cd512492d2e3][Stability]] exists when the all of the real component of the poles are less than or equal to zero.
We can use [[id:7b415c54-da2a-4194-a93a-a04488ca173d][Routhâ€“Hurwitz Stability Criterion]] to find if a system is stable.
   
*** Marginal Stability
When the natural response does not decay to zero, but does not grow either.
Exists when poles are on the $j\omega$ axis


** Steady State Error
The steady state error is:
\[e(\infty) = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0}\frac{sR(s)}{1 + G(s)}\]

\[e_{\textrm{step}}(\infty) = \frac{1}{1 + K_p}\]
 - Where \[K_p = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0} G(s)\]


*** Disturbances
Represented by another [[id:c7591f3a-c2d4-4591-b6af-b0db831a296c][Transfer Function]] being added to some part of the system
With unity feedback we can get the error as:
 - \[E(s) = \frac{1}{1 + G_1(s) G_2(s)}R(s) + \frac{G_2(s)}{1 + G_1(s) G_2(s)}D(s)\]
   - $G_1(s)$ is the controller
   - $G_2(s)$ is the plant
Using the [[id:4e024817-5a11-4519-a4af-ada17c08e3de][Final Value Theorem]]:
 - \[e(\infty) = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0}s E(s) = e_R(\infty) + e_d(\infty)\]
Where 
 - \[e_D(\infty) = \frac{1}{\lim_{s\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{G_2(s)} + \lim_{s\rightarrow 0}G_1(s)}\]
More error is present in the output when there are more integrators in $G_2$ than $G_1$

To convert non-unity feedback to unity feedback
\[G_e(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)- G(s)}\]
 - $H(s)$ is the feedback



** System Sensitivity
Typically when we make a system faster we also make it easier to make unstable.
Robustness is when we want to meet some requirement and allow for variation without making the system stable
Sensitivity is defined as:
\[S_{F: P} = \lim_{\Delta P\rightarrow 0}\frac{\textrm{Fractional change in } F}{\textrm{Fractional change in } P} = \frac{P}{F}\frac{\partial F}{\partial P}\]

*** For A Second Order System
Sensitivity of $a$
\[T(s) = \frac{K}{s^2 + as + K\]
\[P_{T:a} = \frac{a}{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial a} = \frac{-as}{s^2 + as + K}\]

*** Example
[[xopp-pages:/home/baley/UTAS/org-roam/org-files/System_Sensitivity_Example.xopp]]

** Standard Closed Loop Model
:TODO: Add Image when slides are released

*** Gang Of Six
A set of transfer functions can be derived. These determeine how the system will behave.
:TODO: Add the gang of six
Plotting these will give insight into how the system behaves
**** Gang Of Four
The Gang Of Six can be simplified to the Gang Of Four if the feedforward term is set to 1 ($F = 1$):
:TODO: Add the gang of four
