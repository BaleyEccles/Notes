* Buck Converters
[[./Buck_conventions.svg]]
Does DC-DC voltage convertion. It converts a higher voltage to a lower one, this also will increase current.
 - The PWM determines how much of the voltage is converted.
 - The frequcney of the PWM will change how the filter is designed

** Pulse Width Modulation
In digital application, the accuracy of the PWM is deterimed by the size of the timer used.
 - A 8-bit timer gives divisions of $100/8 = 12.5\%$

** Analysis
[[./Buck_operating.svg]]
When the PWM is on the on state the diode is reveres biased.
When the PWM is off the diode is forward biased.

In continuous conduction mode (current is positive):

If the off time is too long the buck convert will enter discontinuous conduction mode.
In discontinuous conduction mode (current is not positive):
