* System Stability
[[id:847ec0e7-da66-447a-9835-cd512492d2e3][Stability]] exists when the all of the real component of the poles are less than or equal to zero.
We can use [[id:7b415c54-da2a-4194-a93a-a04488ca173d][Routhâ€“Hurwitz Stability Criterion]] to find if a system is stable.
   
** Marginal Stability
When the natural response does not decay to zero, but does not grow either.
Exists when poles are on the $j\omega$ axis

** Disturbances
Represented by another [[id:c7591f3a-c2d4-4591-b6af-b0db831a296c][Transfer Function]] being added to some part of the system
With unity feedback we can get the error as:
 - \[E(s) = \frac{1}{1 + G_1(s) G_2(s)}R(s) + \frac{G_2(s)}{1 + G_1(s) G_2(s)}D(s)\]
   - $G_1(s)$ is the controller
   - $G_2(s)$ is the plant
Using the [[id:4e024817-5a11-4519-a4af-ada17c08e3de][Final Value Theorem]]:
 - \[e(\infty) = \lim_{s\rightarrow 0}s E(s) = e_R(\infty) + e_d(\infty)\]
Where 
 - \[e_D(\infty) = \frac{1}{\lim_{s\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{G_2(s)} + \lim_{s\rightarrow 0}G_1(s)}\]
More error is present in the output when there are more integrators in $G_2$ than $G_1$

To convert non-unity feedback to unity feedback
\[G_e(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)- G(s)}\]
 - $H(s)$ is the feedback
