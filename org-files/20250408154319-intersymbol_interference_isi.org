* Intersymbol Interference (ISI)

 - \[z(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}a_np(t - nT_s)\]
The channel $h(t)$ is not often distortionless. The channel may have a impulse response that is band-limited, $H(f)$. $P(f)\cdot H(f)$, this makes the signal band-limited. This causes the signal to be spread out.
Sending future signals will Intersymbol Interfere (ISI) with each other.
We can make $p(t)$ not a square to combat this. This will be done by filtering
 - \[H(f) = H_t(f)H_c(f)H_r(f)\]
   - at $t = nT_s$
** The Niquist zero-ISI Criterion
 - \[R(t) \neq 0, \ t = 0\]
 - \[R(t) =    0, \ t \in \{\pm T_s, \pm 2T_s, \pm 3T_s, \hdots\}\]
   - \[= h_t(t)*h_r(t)\]
 - \[R(t) = g(t)*g^H(-t)\]
 - Can be met if we use the Niquist Pulse
   - \[R(t) = \textrm{sinc}(t)\]
     - For $T_s = 1$
 - A more common choice
  - TODO
