* Stationary Process
** Types
*** Strict-Sense Stationary (SSS)
 - Every statistic of $X(t)$ does not depend on $t$, and is self similar.
*** Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS)
 - $E[X(t)]=\mu_X$ is not a function of time
 - _AND_ $E[X(t)X(t+\tau)=R_{XX}(t)]$ is only a function of $\tau$, and not time explicitly.
**** Jointly WSS
 - $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ are jointly WSS if:
   - Each is WSS on their own
   - _AND_ $R_{XY}(t,t+\tau)=R_{XT}(\tau)$
