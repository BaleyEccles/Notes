* Linear and Time Invarient Systems (LTI)
An LTI has both the properties: [[id:0e057e37-e287-469b-8085-d0c2f94713c1][Signal Linearity]] and [[id:949eb0e5-3855-46f6-bc68-67f16c04c961][Time Invariance]].
** Odinary Differential Equation Form
In general LTIs can be represented by constant coefficient ODEs.
\[\sum_{j=0}^N a_j \frac{d^j y(t)}{dt^j}=\sum_{k=0}^M b_k \frac{d^k x(t)}{dt^k}\]
This comes with the implication that the ODE is at rest initially, that is has no energy.
