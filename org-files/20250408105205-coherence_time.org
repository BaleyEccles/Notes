* Coherence Time
 - The amount of time that the channel remains the 'same'.
The [[id:cfec5fb5-467e-4a16-a78c-32ebbdd4fb9a][channel]] is expected to change over time. If at $t_1$ we have the [[id:8c187cae-c6ec-4298-85ef-12448f78b5e6][impulse response]] $h(t_1,t)$ and at $t_2$ we have the impulse response $h(t_2,t)$. The channel will have changed by $h(t_2,t)-h(t_2,t)$. If this is large the channel has undergone decoherence, Coherence Time is the measure of this time.

** Cases
1. \[\Delta T > T_s\]
   - The channel does not change significantly during symbol transmission.
2. \[\Delta T < T_s\]
   - The channel does change significantly during symbol transmission.
** Notation
Denoted
 - \[\Delta T\]
