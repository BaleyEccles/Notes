* Transformer Power Losses
** Losses To [[id:bd829d16-0ded-4f21-8ce7-a99a79d1a078][Hysteresis]]
- Some energy is lost to hysteresis
  - \[P_{h}=K_h\cdot f \cdot B^{1.6}_{max}\]
    - \[K_h\] is a constant depending on the mateiral
    - \[f\] is the frequency
    - \[B_{max}\] is the max [[id:cf104375-09b0-4334-84ce-3e0e1f41c234][Magnetic Flux Density]] established in the core
** Losses To Eddy Currents
- When the [[id:3ab115b0-6e42-46ec-b987-bd09c10d0ec6][Magnetic Flux]] ocillates eddy currents are created in the secondary and the core.
  - \[P_e=K_e\cdot f^2 \cdot B^{2}_{max}\]
    - \[K_e\] is a constant depending on the mateiral
    - \[f\] is the frequency
    - \[B_{max}\] is the max [[id:cf104375-09b0-4334-84ce-3e0e1f41c234][Magnetic Flux Density]] established in the core
  - This can be reduced by
    - Using different materials
    - Laminating the core
      - Each sheet is electrically seperated
** Total loss
\[P_c=P_h+P_e\]
** Saturation
When the current input pushes the core into the saturation region, the output voltage is creates a peak rather than a perfect sin wave.

** Flux Leakage
 - \[L_{l1}=\frac{N_1\phi_{l1}}{i_1}\rightarrow X_{l1}=\omega L_{l1}= 2\pi fL_{l1}\]
 - \[L_{l2}=\frac{N_2\phi_{l2}}{i_2}\rightarrow X_{l2}=\omega L_{l2}= 2\pi fL_{l2}\]
