*Using oscilloscope cursors in time domain, measure and calculate the phase difference between the two waveforms. Compare with the Lissajous pattern you have plotted with recognised patterns published elsewhere. Save waveforms and include in your lab report.*

The time delay between the channels was measured as $\Delta t=2.47\mu s$ at $f=90.2kHz$, giving a phase offset $\phi = 360^o f\Delta t\approx 80.2^o$
The Lissajous ellipse corresponds to a constant phase difference and, using the intercept method, is consistent with 
$\approx80^o$ within cursor resolution.

*Record an image of a single pulse (or a train of pulses), showing clearly the shape of the rising and falling edges.*

*Record the measured Fourier spectrum. Using cursors measure and record the magnitude of the fundamental and the first 5 major harmonics. Calculate the RMS value of each of these harmonic components (noting that 1 V = 20 dB), tabulate and compare with theoretical values which you can obtain by using Fourier analysis of this waveform.*

A square wave is given by the equation:
\[f(t) = \frac{4A}{\pi}\sum_{n=1,3,5\hdots}^{\infty}\frac{\sin\left(\frac{2\pi n t}{T}\right)}{n}\]
By increasing $n$ by one we increase the harmonic by one and divide its magnitude by $n$.
To check if this holds for our gathered data we must divide our voltage by the harmonic number and compare it with the recorded one.

As seen in Table \ref{tab:Table_2} the recorded and calculated voltages differ very little. So, it would be safe to say that using Fourier analysis to analyse this is valid.

*Using the diode IV function (in lecture slides) try to fit a theoretical curve to your measured data (find a reverse saturation current Is and emission factor n that works).*

\[I_d = I_s \left( e^{\frac{-V_{dc}}{n V_T}} - 1 \right)\]

We can estimate $n \approx 500$ and $I_s \approx 40\mu A$, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Diode_Reverse_IV}.

*Comment on the shape of the curve and on its particular features. What deviations, if any, do you observe, compared to your fitted curve?*

Our data does not fit the expected exponential form very well, in fact it is perfectly linear, this is due to inaccuracies in the setup. We are attempting to measure micro amps, which was barely possible using the given ammeter. We also estimated a ideality factor of 500, which is not reasonable, it is expected to be between 1 and 2. 

*Look up the specifications / datasheet for your diode and comment on how they relate to your experiment and observations.*

The measured data matches what is expected from the data sheet. Specifically when it comes to the max reverse current, according to the data sheet it is not possible to draw more than $10 \mu A$ at $25^oC$, which we were unable to do. Likewise, our forward voltage never exceeded $0.95V$, as the datasheet suggests.

*If this diode were used in a rectifier circuit where it was in its ON state 50% of the time (with a constant current of 0.7 A), what would the diode losses be (assume zero off-state losses)?*

\begin{align*}
P &= VI \\
P &= 0.75\times 0.7\times 0.5 \\
P &= 0.2625W
\end{align*}


**** Reverse Recovery Characteristics of Diode

*Include in your report the current waveform (and diode voltage) at switch on and switch off. Note how it differs at turn off from what you may have expected under ideal conditions.*

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [H]
#+CAPTION: Diode Voltage \label{fig:Diode_Current}
[[./ENG306_Lab1_PartA_3.2_Diode_Current.png]]

Under ideal conditions we would expect the diode to instantaneously turn on/off. In Figure \ref{fig:Diode_Current} we can see that this is not true, it takes time for the diode to reach steady state.

*Discuss your observations when the diode turns off. What do you think is happening immediately after the source changes from positive to negative? What do you think might happen if the load was much lower?*

When the diode turns off there is still some energy stored in the silicon in the P-N junction, it takes time for this energy to dissipate. As we see the energy does not instantaneously exit the junction. If the load was lower we would expect less energy to be present in the junction, leading to a quicker dissipation of it.

*Estimate the turn off time for your diode.*

From Figure \ref{fig:Diode_Current} we estimate the turnoff time to be about $15\mu s$.

*** 3.3
**** Thyristor Characteristics

*Report and comment on the gate supply voltage required to turn on the thyristor, and on the thyristor voltage observed after turn on.*

The voltage required to turn the thyristor on was about $5V$, and once turned on the voltage across the thyristor was approximately $1V$.

*Explain your observations when gate voltage is reduced to zero subsequent to the thyristor being turned on?*

When the gate current was reduced to zero the thyristors current and voltage remained the same.

*What thyristor voltage and current did you measure just prior to thyristor turn off? What is this current value referred to as?*

When the thyristors voltage at turn off was approximately $4V$ and its current was about $20mA$

#+RESULTS:

*Comment on the observed IV characteristics, relating it to theoretical expectations.*

The IV plot represents how the voltage and current changes in the thyristor when it is transitioning from an on state to an off state. As the source voltage decreased the thyristor voltage and current decreased. Up until a point when the source voltage is not large enough to keep the thyristor on, then the entire source voltage is across the thyristor, leading to a positive jump in voltage across the thyristor, and zero current through the thyristor.

*Reflect on how this lab session has contributed to your learning experience. How has the lab session influenced your understanding of switching devices used in power electronics?*

This lab session has helped us learn by showing us how to deal with non-ideal components and their switching characteristics. We have applied theoretical analysis techniques to get accurate answers in real world applications
