* Fading
\[r = h*a\]
Two types:

** [[id:788c38cf-cc37-463b-84d6-a40be1715904][Non-Dispersive Fading]]
Scattering of the transmitted signal causes very small path delays compared to the signal period.

** [[id:abae31a2-cc7c-4a2d-b1cf-ed322480482e][Multipath Fading]]
There can be several scatters in the channel that results in copies of the signal being received at various time delays.
