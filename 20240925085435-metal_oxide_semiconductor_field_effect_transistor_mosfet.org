* Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET)
 - [[id:1a5a7101-2779-487c-9f19-9722a835f358][Semiconductor]] device that can be used as a switch, resistor or amplifier.
 - Voltage controlled, unlike [[id:47517c75-582b-4948-a2a7-f88e883e7b65][Bipolar Junction Transistors]]
** Depletion
 - When voltage is applied to the gate, the conductivity reduces

   - Two channel types

     - P-channel
       - Has a [[id:18aa5061-7346-462c-9f77-d0a6c6e2752c][P-type]] material as the channel
     - N-channel
       - Has a [[id:71e4c0dc-4fd7-4ad0-a4e4-9eb1f0a352bc][N-type]] material as the channel
*** Equations
 - Same equations as the [[id:93c76c0b-cbbe-4688-8921-07db5a4d01ca][JFET]], except that $I_G$ is exactly 0 amps.
 - \[I_{D}=I_{DSS}\left(1-\frac{V_{GS}}{V_P}\right)^{2}\]
 - \[I_{D}=I_{S}\]
 - \[I_G=0A\]
** Enhancement
 - When voltage is applied to the gate, the conductivity increases
